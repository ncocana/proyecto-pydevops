We create a database using MongoDB Atlas,we extract the data stored using the Mongo Data API and his Keys to programm into Python. In this order once the extract 
it's succesfully,we added test cases for every file. At the end we programmed a function in Python to write the HTML for each page of our website and we mix them
with CSS styles.
